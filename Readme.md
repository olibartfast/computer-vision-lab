## Image Function
This section covers basic image operations and transformations:
- **Image Function Operations**: Likely covers basic pixel-level operations
- **Linear Transform**: Fundamental transformations like scaling, rotation, shearing
- **Homogeneous Coordinate/Transformation**: Essential for representing transformations in projective geometry

## Matching
Focuses on image comparison and feature matching techniques:
- **Basic Comparisons**: Pixel-level and feature-based matching
- **Statistical Measures**: Image moments, similarity metrics, distance functions
- **Distribution-Based Methods**: Cross entropy for comparing probability distributions
- **Cross Correlation**: Both 1D implementation and efficient matrix multiplication approaches
- **Convolution**: Related operation with different directional properties

## Projection
Covers 3D to 2D projection concepts:
- **Multiple Coordinate Systems**: World, camera, and image coordinates
- **Multiview Projection**: How 3D points project onto different viewing planes
- **3D Transformations**: Translation and rotation in 3D space
- **Camera Motion**: How camera movement affects the projected image

## Stereo
Advanced topics in multi-camera geometry:
- **Extrinsic Matrix**: Camera pose in world coordinates
- **Pinhole Camera Model**: Standard camera projection model
- **Intrinsic Matrix**: Internal camera parameters
- **Epipolar Geometry**: Geometric constraints between two views
- **Essential Matrix**: Encodes the epipolar constraint
